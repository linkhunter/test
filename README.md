# Gut microbiota impacts bone via Bacteroides vulgatus-valeric acid-related pathways
We performed integrative analyses in a Chinese cohort (n = 517) of peri-/post-menopausal women with metagenomics/targeted metabolomics/whole-genome sequencing to identify novel microbiome-related biomarkers for bone health. We also performed validations in US Caucasians (n = 59).
## Document 1: Chinese cohort 
### Each row represents each subject (ID). 
### Column B - G: indeies of bone by micro CT
BMD - bone mineral density
R_UD - ultra-distal radius
U_UD - ultra-distal ulna
RU_UD - ultra-distal radius and ulna
NECK - femoral neck
HTOT - left total hip
L1_L4 - lumbar spine
### Column H - R: covariates
YSM - years since menopause
BMI - body mass index
FSH - follicle stimulating hormone
Calcium_history: 0 - none, 1 - sometimes, 2- often
Alcohol_Drink: 0 - never, 1 - sometimes
Exercise: 0 - none, 1 - less than 2.5 hours per week, 2 - more than 2.5 hours per week
Strength of work: 0 - non physical labor, 1 - physical labor
Family annual income: 0 - low, 1 - normal, 2 - high
Smoking: 0 - none, 1 - yes
EducationLevel: 0 - Less than high school graduate, 1 - High school graduate, 2 - College, 3 - Graduate
### Column S - WP: KEGG modules (relative abundance)
### Column WQ - WV: serum short chain fatty acids
### Column WW - PDC: gut microbiota (species level, relative abundance)
## Document 2: US cohort
### Each row represents each subject (ID). 
### Column B: index of bone by micro CT (left total hip bone mineral density)
### Column C - K: covariates (0 - no, 1 - yes)
### Column L - AL: gut microbiota (species level, relative abundance)
